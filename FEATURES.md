The features of the Covey Spaces include:

- _Spaces_ allow players to communicate regardless of proximity
- _Spaces_ have designated and easily accesible locations (landmarks)
- _Spaces_ remove distractions outside of the spaces
- Any player can join the space by walking in

### A space becomes private if claimed by a player:

- The player who claims the space becomes the host:
  - The host can change the whitelist by adding or removing players
  - The host can designate a presenter
  - The host can disband the space (relinquish their host privileges)
- The player who is designated as presenter (by the host):
  - Will have their video prioritized for all users in the space
- Players on the whitelist can join a space:
  - See the video of all the players in the same space
  - Not be distracted by players outside the space
- Players not on the whitelist cannot join a space:
  - A player will be teleported to spawn if they try joining the space

### Joining a Space

Players can join a space by walking into the designated locations on the map.

To Become the host a player must enter a space that does not already have a host and press the button on the bottom bar that says "claim space". Once the player becomes the host they will be able to press a button that says "space controlls" that gives them the option to change the whitelist and choose which player will be the presenter if any. selecting these options and pressing the "update space" button will finalize their changes. They will also be given the option to disband the space which will restore the space to it's default settings, this will put all players on the whitelist and make it so there is no presenter or host for the space.
